# Morse Smale Complex and Partition Based Regression
Morse Smale Complex provides topologically meaningfull decomposition of domain. 

In this program, We use this technique to get the different partitions of the entire domain and apply simple regression models over each domains. 

We have tested the progrm for sample data upto 10-Dimensions (y,x1,x2,..,x10) from real applications (details in report.pdf). 

## Requirment
**R software** with "msr" package installed

## Parameters
Linear Model or Quadratic Model
